# Valorant Agent Tool
### A simple tool that displays information about Valorant agents

---

This is a tool that I developed as part of a tool development course at my University.

It's written in C# and uses WPF & XAML for the UI. It accesses a [public HTML API](https://valorant-api.com), that contains a lot of information about Valorant, but I chose to display the agents and their abilities.

It has the ability to load the data either through the web by accessing the API, or by accessing the embedded JSON file, which I parse using the [Newtonsoft.Json library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json/13.0.3?_src=template). You are able to switch between the two repositories at runtime.

### Why Valorant?
---

Valorant is one of my favorite games and the first game that made me want to play it extensively. 

Additionally, working at Riot Games has been a long-time dream of mine, so creating a tool centered around one of their games felt like the perfect fit.
